# CsGoPrivateServer
This enables users to create and manage privately hosted Counter Strike: Global Offensive servers on AWS.

## Setting up your work environment
Once you clone the project, run `npm install` and create a `.env` file in the root directory with following variables
```
PORT=8080
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_access_key
AWS_REGION=ap-south-1
```

Launch the server with `node index.js`.

## API Documentation
For API documentation, the project uses [ApiDoc](https://apidocjs.com/). Please stick to the standards. See existing APIs in `app` folder.

API documentation can be generated by `scripts/generat_apidoc`. You would need to give executable permission to `generat_apidoc`. 

Once local environment is setup, and local server is running, API documentation can be seen at `http://localhost:8080/api/documentation`
